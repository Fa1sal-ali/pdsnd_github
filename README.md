### Project Title
**Explore US Bikeshare Data**

### Description
In this project, we used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in
the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. We wrote code to import the data and
answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. We also wrote a script that
takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
We used the following files provided by Udacity to work on this project:
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv
